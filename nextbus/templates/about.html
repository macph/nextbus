      <h3>This website</h3>
      <p>This is a personal project.</p>
      <p>As a long-time bus user, I have often been frustrated by how difficult it is to plan around bus timetables and the lack of access to live, up to date information for buses, especially on mobile. I created this website to gain experience in building websites and to provide a service.</p>
